Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jieyuan Chen, and you can simply call me Charlie. I'm a  data science student diving deep into the fascinating world of data analysis and machine learning. My academic journey is currently centered around harnessing the power of Python, R and SQL, which are pivotal tools in the data science toolkit. ðŸŒ±

I'm always eager to collaborate on projects that involve data visualization, predictive modeling, or any innovative use of data analytics. ðŸ‘¯ If you're working on something where my growing skills can contribute, let's team up and explore the possibilities together!

My passion for data has led me to embark on two exciting projects. The first one involves developing a Python package for a Financial Data API. This project is not just about tapping into financial datasets but also about creating tools for in-depth financial market analysis. The second project is a fascinating intersection of sports and political structures, where I'm exploring how these two realms influence each other in a social science context. These projects reflect my diverse interests and my enthusiasm for applying data science across different fields.

On a personal note, I identify with she/her/hers pronouns. ðŸ˜„ And here's a fun fact about me: I'm an avid soccer fan and I am currently learning Spanish because of it. I also identify myself as a passionate researcher in history. My fascination with history is more than just a pursuit; it's a journey into understanding the complexities of our past. I am captivated by the discipline's ability to unravel the stories and events that have shaped our presence. By integrating data analysis and digital tools, I aspire to bring a more nuanced and accurate perspective to historical research, enriching our understanding of the past with the precision and depth that modern technology enables. Any insights into applying data science techniques to historical data would be incredibly valuable.

If you're interested in connecting, collaborating, or just having a chat about data science, reach me at jc6102@columbia.edu or connect with me on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/jieyuan-chen-382623196/

Looking forward to the amazing connections and learning opportunities that await in the world of data science!
